## Incredibly Simple TypeScript Node Library Template

Almost zero fluff template for people who just want to make a TypeScript library in Node and are too lazy to care about other things.

Includes:
- Jest testing in TypeScript with coverage.
- ESLint with recommended rules and some of my own rules.
- Some configurations.
- That's about it.

Change whatever as you see fit.  
You should change the `person` and `library` placeholders in `package.json` and `LICENSE`.
